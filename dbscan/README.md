## The implementation of K-means and DBSCAN algorithm

Two types of clustering algorithm, partition-based K-means and density-based DBSCAN were
implemented in Java. While the implementation is mainly adapted from published pseudocode, adjustments were
made in order to improve the consistency for K-means results and the performance of DBSCAN. Then, both of
the implemented algorithms were tested and compared on synthetic as well as real datasets. Further, JavaFX GUI
was created in order for the dataset import as well as the parameter input.
